# Manual-testing scenarios

- Basic editing experience:
  - Create a snippet, both "new" and from a sample
  - Deletes/renames/etc should work correctly and persist even if you close/re-open the app.
  - When deleting the last snippet, the backstage should pop up, showing the samples gallery.
- Login to github
  - Should be able to log in
  - Should see your snippets in snippets list
    - Note: there's an issue with IE 11 on both Win32 and Office Online that does not allow for consenting to GitHub OAuth apps via IE (issue [#248](https://github.com/OfficeDev/script-lab-react/issues/248)). The current workaround is to load [this](https://script-lab.azureedge.net/) url in Chrome/Edge/Firefox/etc. and sign-in and consent in that window. After consenting in that browser, you should be able to use the GitHub functionality within the app by signing in again, and this time it should succeed.
- Import someone elses' snippet
  - From YAML
  - From Gist
  - Both regular and custom functions
  - On import failure, should see error.
  - If import a gist that is already present in the workspace, the user should be prompted to choose whether to open the previously imported gist, import the gist anew, or cancel.
    - Note: today, will only prompt for _your_ gists in the the "my gists" list, but NOT for URLs imported in the Import tab. Bug [#274](https://github.com/OfficeDev/script-lab-react/issues/274) tracks improving this soon.
- Sharing:
  - Copying to clipboard works
  - Can share as gist, public and private
    - Gist URL should be updated in snippet information
  - Can update existing gist
  - Update option should not appear in share menu after importing a gist that you do not own
  - Update option appears in share menu after initial publish of a new gist or a gist that you did not previously own
  - Deleting a gist (on the github website) and then trying to update it from Script Lab should have a reasonable behavior (some sort of error message?)
- Run snippet, in both in-editor runner (the only option for Office 2016 RTM and earlier) and via the "Run" button (run.html), testing that:
  - Snippet renders correctly
  - "Run" from editor or run gallery, in-place refresh, and full refresh all work correctly (render the snippet, don't double-refresh, etc.). The run (either type) doesn't show a "snippet needs reloading" message if the snippet is already fresh.
  - Console log renders correctly (and scrolls correctly, if many lines)
  - Thrown errors from user code are reflected in the console.
  - Erroneous code (e.g, syntax error) shows error correctly.
  - Running deleted snippet has reasonable behavior.
  - [Side-by-side runner]:
    - Edit to code causes runner want to refresh.
    - Whether starting from error or going to error state and back out, should act correctly.
- Ribbon buttons (Add-in):
  - The Script Lab tab is visible with its buttons
  - The buttons aside from Run/Code/Functions open web pages (and this works on all platforms)
- Misc:
  - On both editor and runner, should be able to trigger a runtime error via the browser (e.g., type the following into the console: `setTimeout(function() { throw new Error("Test") } , 500)`), and it should trigger an error experience.
