# Manual-testing scenarios

- Basic editing experience:
  - Create a snippet
    - "new"
    - from a sample
  - Deletes/renames/etc should work correctly and persist even if you close/re-open the app.
  - When deleting the last snippet, the backstage should show the samples gallery.
- Import someone else's snippet
  - From YAML
  - From Gist url
  - From URL
  - Both regular and custom functions
  - On import failure, should see error.
- Sharing:
  - Copying to clipboard works
- Run snippet, in both in-editor runner (the only option for Office 2016 RTM and earlier) and via the "Run" button (run.html), testing that:
  - Snippet renders correctly
  - "Run" from editor or run gallery, in-place refresh, and full refresh all work correctly (render the snippet, don't double-refresh, etc.). The run (either type) doesn't show a "snippet needs reloading" message if the snippet is already fresh.
  - Console log renders correctly (and scrolls correctly, if many lines)
  - Thrown errors from user code are reflected in the console.
  - Erroneous code (e.g, syntax error) shows error correctly.
  - Running deleted snippet has reasonable behavior.
  - [Side-by-side runner]:
    - Edit to code causes runner want to refresh.
    - Whether starting from error or going to error state and back out, should act correctly.
- Ribbon buttons (Add-in):
  - The Script Lab tab is visible with its buttons
  - The buttons aside from Run/Code/Functions open web pages (and this works on all platforms)
- Misc:
  - On both editor and runner, should be able to trigger a runtime error via the browser (e.g., type the following into the console: `setTimeout(function() { throw new Error("Test") } , 500)`), and it should trigger an error experience.
