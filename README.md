## What is Script Lab?

Wouldn't it be crazy if you could launch Excel, click to open a small code window, and then instantly start writing and executing JavaScript that interacts with your spreadsheet?

Script lab is a tool for anyone who wants to learn about writing Office Add-ins for Excel, Outlook, Word, or PowerPoint. The focus is the Office JavaScript API, which is the technology you need for building Office Add-ins that run across platforms. Maybe you're an experienced Office developer and you want to quickly prototype a feature for your add-in. Or maybe you've never tried writing code for Office and you just want to play with a sample and tweak it to learn more. Either way, Script Lab is for you.

Script Lab has three main features:

- **Code** in a pane beside your spreadsheet.
  - IntelliSense is there while you type so you can easily discover and use the Office JavaScript objects and methods. Script Lab uses the Monaco editor, the same tech that powers VS Code, so it's beautiful and lightweight.
  - Samples are pre-installed with Script Lab, so you don't have to start from scratch
  - Your can use any TypeScript features like arrow functions, template strings, and async/await (i.e., a good chunk of ES6 and ES7 features). But it's not only script: your snippets can also use HTML, CSS, and references to external libraries and data on the web.
- **Run** the code in another pane beside the editor.
  - Execution can include logic, API calls to Office, UI in the pane, and even output to a console.
  - Every time you make a code change you can refresh the editor and run the new version in seconds.
- **Share** your snippets.
  - If you create a snippet you'd like to share, you can copy it to your clipboard, save it as a GitHub gist. Then send the gist link to someone else to use on their computer.
  - The Import feature lets you load other people's snippets.

Script Lab works in Office 2013 or later on Windows, Office on the web, or Office on Mac.

You can get [Script Lab](https://appsource.microsoft.com/product/office/WA104380862) right now for free from Microsoft AppSource! It works for Excel, Word, and PowerPoint.

If you're interested in developing for Outlook, you can get [Script Lab for Outlook](https://appsource.microsoft.com/product/office/WA200001603), also free from AppSource.

Script Lab is a Microsoft Garage project that began at a hackathon. You can read the story of the original Script Lab creation on the [Garage website](https://www.microsoft.com/garage/profiles/script-lab/).

Here's a 1-minute teaser video:

## Get Started

[Explore Office JavaScript API using Script Lab](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/overview/explore-with-script-lab)

This 10-minute demo explains how to use the main features:

## Import someone else's snippet, or export your own

Script Lab is built around sharing. If someone gives you a URL to a GitHub Gist, simply open Script Lab, use the hamburger menu at the top left to see the menu, and choose "Import" category (either on the left or top, depending on the available screen space). Then, enter the URL of the Gist, and click the "Import" button at the bottom of the screen. In just these few clicks, you will be able to view and run someone else's snippet!

Conversely, to share _your_ snippet with someone, choose the "Copy to clipboard" button with the open snippet. You can share as a public [GitHub Gist](https://help.github.com/articles/about-gists/), or you can paste the snippet from the clipboard, and share it from there.

## Report a bug, or suggest a feature

To report a bug, [create a new issue](https://github.com/OfficeDev/script-lab/issues/new). Please provide as much detail as you can, tell us: the operating system, the Office build number, and your browser (if you're using Office on the web).

If you have a suggestion for a feature, please feel free to file it under "issues" as well, and we will tag it appropriately. The more detail, the better! (see more at [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)).
