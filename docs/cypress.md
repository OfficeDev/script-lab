# Cypress

The editor has UI test automation implemented using [cypress](https://www.cypress.io/).

To open cypress, navigate to `packages/editor`.

Then, run the npm script `test:cypress`.

Wait until you see that localhost:3000 has started in the terminal, then click the test file you wish to run in the cypress ui.
