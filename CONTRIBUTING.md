# Running Script Lab React from source

## Prereq:

- Download & Install Visual Studio Code. <https://code.visualstudio.com/>.
- Install the recommended VS extensions (which you should be prompted for when you open the repo).
- Download & install Node (version v10+). <https://nodejs.org/en>.
- Download & install Yarn, for use as an alternative for `npm install`. Download from <https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install> (or bootstrap Yarn installation by running once `npm install -g yarn`). The documentation also describes why Yarn is preferable to `npm install`.

Note: the installation of Node JS and Yarn add paths to your operating system's PATH variable. Therefore, in some cases you may log off and log in from your System to get Node JS and Yarn work withing Visual Studio Code.

## Build steps:

From the root of the repo:

1. `yarn install`
2. `yarn start`

## Trust the certificates

Trust the certificates for each of <https://localhost:3000> (editor), <https://localhost:3200> (runner), and <https://localhost:5000> (server). For purposes of running add-ins on a PC, do this within Internet Explorer. See the gif below for a step-by-step animation:

This is a particularly critical step for loading the Add-in inside of Office on a PC. If you fail to trust the certificates, you might see the following error:

![](.github/images/add-in-loading-error.png).

## Testing inside of an add-in

1. Locate the add-in manifest (which you'll find in the `manifests` folder in the root of the repo). For purposes of running against localhost, use `localhost.xml`.

2. Sideload the manifest into your office host application. See <https://aka.ms/sideload-addins>, which includes instructions and a step-by-step video for sideloading on the desktop, as well as links for the other platforms.

## [Optional] Testing GitHub auth locally (on localhost)

1. Go to <https://github.com/settings/developers>, and click "[Register new application](https://github.com/settings/applications/new)" if you haven't done it before for your own dev copy of ScriptLab.
2. Give it a name like "ScriptLab Local Dev", with a Homepage and Auth callback URL of `https://localhost:3000`.
3. Plumb this client ID and secret through (instructions TBD -- TODO).

# Manual-testing scenarios

Please see "[TESTING.md](TESTING.md)".
